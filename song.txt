Yesterday. All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as all they're here to stay
And I believe in yesterday.
Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be

There is shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday

Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
There is a shadow hanging over me
